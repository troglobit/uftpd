Description: No nonsense TFTP/FTP server
 uftpd is a small and simple TFTP and FTP server intended for LANs.  Its
 author runs it on the Internet, although this is not recommended.
 .
 uftpd is set up in a read-only configuration by default.  It has no
 users, except for anonymous, no configuration file, and is started
 on-demand by the UNIX inetd super server, neatly tcpwrapped for your
 safety.
 .
 Hardcore Internet users and anyone concerned about security should
 probably consider a separate TFTP server and for FTP look at one of:
 vsftpd, proftpd, or pure-ftpd.
